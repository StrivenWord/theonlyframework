## Contributing
You could perhaps [open an issue](https://github.com/StrivenWord/theonlyframework/issues), and we could perhaps discuss it. Or make a PR. Or fork the repo and do whatever you want.

## Misc
The author of the original best motherfucking website has a blog [theme](https://github.com/denysvitali/hugo-thebestmotherfuckingblog), for the Hugo static site generator, which you might be interested in.

This webpage was inspired by an AI response from a research chat thread using DeepSeek on t3.chat, the AI chat platform made by the same creator whose [YouTube vlog](https://youtu.be/BQnLsQwWdpY?si=v5kRxWzG8vy9uYHy) introduced the present writer to _thebestmotherfucking.website_.

The topic of the AI chat is the school of theology known as neo-orthodoxy, which formed the basis of the joke for this project, which is attempting to take part in the conversation surrounding web dev workflows and all these fucking websites, while implicating the neoredemptivist and mainline revival theology nerd communities in which context this was made and shared.
